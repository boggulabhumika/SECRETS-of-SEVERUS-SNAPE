# Secrets of Severus Snape: Web Scraping & Sentiment Analysis in Python

# Introduction
Remember those epic Saturday nights spent binge-watching Harry Potter with your friends, completely mesmerized by the adventures of Harry, Hermione, and Ron? The films weren't just entertainment—they laid the groundwork for our childhood, mixing friendship, bravery, and a touch of magic. From Hagrid’s unforgettable “You’re a wizard, Harry” moment to the mysterious corridors of Hogwarts, the movies had us hooked.

# Objective
This project dives into the enigma of Professor Snape using web scraping and sentiment analysis. My aim? To decode Snape's emotional landscape and pinpoint the most defining words in his narrative. No sugar-coating—just raw, data-driven insights into one of the wizarding world’s most complex characters.

# Chapter 1: The Art of Web Scraping
I began by harnessing web scraping techniques to fetch Snape’s story from a dedicated webpage. Imagine sending a digital owl to fetch a letter filled with secrets—instead, I retrieved paragraphs brimming with Snape’s tales. With tools like BeautifulSoup and NLTK, I transformed this raw text into a well-organized CSV file, setting the stage for deeper analysis.

# Chapter 2: Brewing the Sentiment Analysis Potion
This is where the real magic happens! I delved into Snape's sentiments using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer potion. By assigning magical labels like 'angry' or 'protective,' I unveiled the emotions that weave through Snape's narrative. The results painted a captivating picture—Snape's worries took the lead, followed by contempt, anger, and a strong sense of protectiveness.

# Chapter 3: Uncovering the Most Enchanted Words
Next, I sifted through the data to extract the top words resonating in Snape’s story. By filtering out the mundane and lemmatizing the text, I identified key terms like "Snape," "Harry," "Dumbledore," "Voldemort," and "Lily." These aren’t just names; they’re the incantations that power the very essence of his character.
